Description: Provides fast implementations of Honest Random Forests, 
    Gradient Boosting, and Linear Random Forests, with an emphasis on inference 
    and interpretability. Additionally contains methods for variable 
    importance, out-of-bag prediction, regression monotonicity, and
    several methods for missing data imputation.
